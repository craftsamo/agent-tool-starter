# Tool conventions

The rules every tool in this package follows, so tools read alike across
domains and harnesses. Each rule carries the reason it was chosen; a change
to a rule changes this file first, with its reason.

<!-- starter -->

A project made from the starter keeps these rules and adds its own below them.

<!-- /starter -->

## Names

- **Tool IDs are `<prefix>_<domain>_<verb>`**: `<prefix>_note_read` and
  `<prefix>_note_create` for a `note` domain. The prefix is `toolPrefix` in
  `src/project.ts`; it keeps a name unambiguous where a harness lists every
  tool in one namespace. When the domain has a well-known command line,
  follow its word order, so a name maps to a command anyone can look up.
- **The same ID in every entry point.** Permission rules and skills are
  written once, and an ID is a public interface: renaming one is a breaking
  change.
- **Verbs are plain**: `create`, `edit`, `delete`, `add`, `remove`, and these
  with a fixed meaning:

  | Verb      | Means                                                        |
  | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | `read`    | the one read tool of a domain (below)                        |
  | `resolve` | find which object a call means                               |
  | `ensure`  | create when missing, reuse when present; never a second copy |

- **One read tool per domain, one write tool per operation.**
  `<prefix>_<domain>_read` takes a `method` argument (`view`, `list`, …). A
  model picks tools worse as their number grows, and reads share one set of
  annotations, so folding them loses nothing. Writes stay apart because a
  merged write tool would carry its strictest class: creating something would
  ask like overwriting it.
- **Names stay within 40 characters**, so a client prefix such as
  `mcp__<server>__` still fits a 64-character limit. `defineTool` enforces
  the shape and the length; `src/tools.test.ts` enforces the prefix.

## Arguments

- **snake_case**, for arguments and for the keys of a result alike: one style
  for everything a model reads.
- **Lists change through flat arguments**: `add_tags`, `remove_tags`. Shallow
  schemas are read reliably by every model the harnesses run. An argument that
  replaces a whole list, where one is needed, is named for the list (`tags`)
  and its description says it replaces.
- **Unknown arguments are refused.** Every entry point validates the
  arguments as strict, so a misspelt one fails as `invalid_argument` instead
  of being ignored.
- **The tools' own install directory is never the working tree.** A harness
  may start a tool inside the directory the package is installed in.
  `ToolContext.ownDir` names it; a tool that reads the working tree refuses
  to treat that directory as the caller's, saying so.

## Results

- **A tool returns its data as a plain object**, with no `ok` envelope. Each
  entry point renders it: the MCP server as `structuredContent` with the
  tool's `outputSchema` plus the same JSON as text, a native plugin as a JSON
  string.
- **A failure throws.** Every harness then sees a failed call (`isError` over
  MCP) rather than a success that carries an error.
- **One exception: what a call created is never lost.** Once a tool has
  created something, a later step of the same call that fails does not throw.
  The result names what was created and lists the failed steps under
  `errors`, keyed by step (`StepErrors`).
- **Text a tool reads is returned as it is.** Content from files or services
  is data, never instructions; every read tool's description and the skills
  say so. Nothing is wrapped or rewritten.

## Errors

A thrown error carries a `code` a caller can branch on, and a message that
says what to do next.

| Code               | When                                                                       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `not_found`        | the object does not exist, or the caller cannot see it                     |
| `forbidden`        | the caller lacks the permission the call needs                             |
| `invalid_argument` | the arguments cannot describe a valid call                                 |
| `stale`            | what the call relied on changed before it could finish                     |
| `unauthenticated`  | the service or program the tool calls is not logged in                     |
| `rate_limited`     | the service refused the call for its rate limit                            |
| `declined`         | the person declined a confirmation the tool asked for                      |
| `upstream_error`   | the service or program the tool calls failed; the message carries its text |
| `internal_error`   | a bug in a tool or an entry point, such as a result off its schema         |

A project adds a code to `src/core/errors.ts` and to this table together.

- **Structure the caller needs goes in `details`, not in the message.** When
  fixing the cause takes more than a sentence (the lint violations, the
  findings, the output of a hook), the error carries it as `details`: a JSON
  object with snake_case keys, like a result. A model then reads the fields
  instead of parsing them back out of prose; the message still says what to
  do next on its own.
- **`details` is fixed when the error is made.** `ToolError` keeps a frozen
  JSON copy, so every entry point renders the same value. The copy is what
  JSON makes of it (`undefined` is dropped, `NaN` becomes `null`), and a value
  JSON cannot write at all, such as a cycle or a `BigInt`, fails where it was
  thrown, as a bug, not where it is rendered.
- **Each entry point passes `details` on only when it is set**, so an error
  without it reads as it always did. The MCP server and the command line put
  it beside the code and the message, as `error.details`. The OpenCode and
  Hermes plugins, whose errors are text, append it to `<code>: <message>` as
  JSON on a line of its own.
- The `errors` of a partial result (`StepErrors`) stay `<code>: <message>`
  strings.

## Write classes

Every tool belongs to one class, and the class sets its MCP annotations.
`openWorldHint` is `true` for every tool.

| Class             | Examples                              | `readOnlyHint` | `destructiveHint` | `idempotentHint` |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| read              | view, list, resolve                   | `true`         | —                 | `true`           |
| add               | create, add                           | `false`        | `false`           | `false`          |
| idempotent change | ensure, adding a tag                  | `false`        | `false`           | `true`           |
| overwrite         | editing a body or title, removing one | `false`        | `true`            | `true`           |
| administrative    | delete, visibility, publishing        | `false`        | `true`            | `false`          |

- **Overwriting counts as destructive**: it loses what was there, and
  harnesses that confirm only destructive tools should still ask before it.
- **A tool takes the strictest class its arguments can reach.**
- **The harness confirms writes.** Every MCP client asks before it runs a
  write tool, so the tool does not ask again by default. Administrative tools
  also carry `_meta["anthropic/requiresUserInteraction"]: true`, which makes
  Claude Code ask even under an allow rule.
- **A native plugin asks the harness's own permission before every non-read
  call**, since the tools a native plugin adds pass through no harness
  approval of their own.
- **It asks for everything the call writes to.** A write tool's `targets`
  resolver names what the call writes to, as the permission rules name it
  (a path, an account, a record). Anything it cannot tell, every tool
  without a resolver, and a target holding `*` or `?` (which a harness would
  store as a pattern) is `*`, and `*` is never stored. An "always" answer then
  covers only what it named, never a write somewhere else.
- **It shows what the call carries, where the tool can say.** Targets are
  ids, so they cannot tell a person from a group, and the person decides on
  the text, the file or the kind of target as much as on where it goes. A
  write tool's `describe` gives short facts (`Label: value`: the kind of
  chat, a file's size) and an optional free text (the message, the body). A
  native plugin's prompt reads the line naming the targets, then the facts,
  then a blank line and the text. An MCP client draws the call's arguments
  in its own prompt, so the MCP server adds nothing.
- **Facts come first and fit; the free text comes last.** Some harnesses cut
  a prompt from its end at a few hundred characters, so the facts are kept
  within the budget of where the prompt is shown, and the text is what is
  cut. A description keeps its first eight facts, labels of 40 characters,
  values of 200 and a text of 2000; anything longer is cut with `…`.
- **Characters other people wrote are shown, never obeyed.** A chat's name
  or a file's name can hold control, bidi and invisible characters that
  forge a line of the prompt or hide part of a value; each is shown as
  `<U+XXXX>`. Where the prompt renders markup, every value is escaped, so a
  name cannot draw a link or a mention. A surface the plugin does not know
  gets the strictest budget and escaping, so a new one is safe before it is
  known.
- **A description never stands between a call and its approval.** A tool
  without `describe`, a `describe` that fails, returns another shape or takes
  longer than 10 s gives the prompt it would have given without one. The
  approval is asked either way, and the targets are never lost with the
  description.
- **`confirm: "elicitation"` adds the tool's own form** for administrative
  tools, where the client offers form-mode elicitation. It is for people who
  switch the client's approvals off: the tool states what will happen in plain
  words and stops on anything but an accept. Where the client does not offer
  elicitation the setting adds nothing, and the harness's approval is then the
  only confirmation.
- **Annotations are hints, not a boundary.** The `read_only` setting
  (below) is what keeps writes out.

## Toolsets and settings

Every entry point takes the same settings:

- **Toolsets**: one per domain, listed in `src/project.ts` with the ones on by
  default. A small default keeps the model's choice sharp.
- **`read_only`** registers no write tool, and wins over every other setting.
- **`tools` / `exclude_tools`** add or remove single tools; an exclusion wins
  over an inclusion.
- **`confirm`** is `harness` (the default) or `elicitation`; it says who asks
  before an administrative tool acts (see "Write classes"). The default leaves
  the question to the harness, whose approval every user already knows.

## The core contract

- A tool spec declares its ID, description, argument schema, output schema,
  toolset and write class; every entry point derives the same metadata from
  it. A write tool also declares `targets(args, context)`, which names what
  the call writes to.
- `execute(args, context)` gets the working directory, an abort signal, an
  optional `ownDir` (the directory the tools are installed in, never the
  working tree) and an optional `confirm(request) => Promise<boolean>` hook.
  Nothing in it names a harness. An entry point supplies `confirm` when the
  `elicitation` setting is on; without it the harness's approval stands, and a
  tool that needs a confirmation treats a missing hook as the harness having
  approved the call.
- `src/core/` uses only the `node:*` modules and plain dependencies, never a
  runtime's own globals (`Bun.spawn`, `Bun.file`, …), so the same code runs on
  Node and on Bun. It knows no project either: names, prefixes and toolsets
  come from `src/project.ts` through the entry points.

## Programs a tool runs

- **Every program a tool runs goes through one runner** built on `exec`, with
  an explicit environment: what the program needs to find itself and
  authenticate is passed through, and nothing else, so a stray variable
  cannot redirect a call. Prompts and colors are switched off, so nothing
  waits on a person and output parses the same everywhere.
- **Every variable the tools read besides the settings is named in
  `toolVariables` in `src/project.ts`**, whether a tool reads it itself or
  passes it through to a program. Codex gives a plugin's server only a few
  basic variables (`PATH`, `HOME` and the like) and those its manifest names,
  and `pnpm run manifests` writes that list from the settings and
  `toolVariables`: a variable left out is set everywhere but in Codex.
- **Every call has a time limit**, and a call that is stopped, by that limit
  or by cancellation, has its child process killed: `SIGTERM`, then `SIGKILL`
  after two seconds. A hung program neither holds a harness forever nor
  outlives its call.
- **The runner maps the program's failures to the error codes above.**

## Tests

- Tests sit beside the code they test (`*.test.ts`) and run on `bun test`;
  CI also starts the built MCP server, plugin and command line under Node and
  lists their tools, so a runtime-only API cannot slip in unnoticed.
- No test reaches a real service. A tool that runs a program is tested
  against a fake of that program on `PATH`.
- A test file stays within about 300 lines, split by topic
  (`<name>.<topic>.test.ts`), so one commit can carry a change and its test.
