PLUGIN_NAME = "agent-tool-starter"

#: The built command-line name used in error and log messages.
CLI_NAME = "agent-tool-starter-cli"

#: The settings the tools themselves read: each snake_case name and a type (``text``, ``boolean``, ``number``,
#: ``list``, ``path`` or ``paths``) or a dict with ``type`` and optional bounds (``integer``, ``min``, ``max``),
#: as in ``src/project.ts``. Write OPTIONS on one line with double quotes. A setting ``a_b`` becomes ``--a-b``.
